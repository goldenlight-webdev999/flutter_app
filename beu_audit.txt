Search feature is gone on customer side. I remember fixing this issue, so we'll have to go back and find out what happened to it. This may affect some of the results

Customer can see timeslots for vendors
Customer cannot book appointment
Customer cannot rate vendors (I could not find a place to do this, I assume this appears once the customer has booked a service)
Customer cannot send an email to suport (Could not find it)
Customers cannot chat with vendors (I could not get this to work, but Saum said that it was working previously, that we just need to "reset the server")
Social Media links don't lead to proper accounts (No way to look at these, but I'm assuming that they do work if you can get to them)
